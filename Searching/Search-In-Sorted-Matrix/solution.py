# You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of distinct integers and a target Integer. Each row in the matrix is sorted, and each column is also sorted; the matrix doesn't necessarily have the same height and width.
# Write a function that returns an array of the row and column Indices of the target Integer if it's contained in the matrix,
# otherwise [-1, -1]

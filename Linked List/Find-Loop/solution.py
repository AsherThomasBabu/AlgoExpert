# Write a function that takes in the head of a singly Linked List that contains a loop (in other words, the list's tail node points to some node

# In the list instead of None/null). The function should return the node (the actual node--not just its value) from which the loop originates in constant space.

# Each LinkedList node has an Integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next node in the list.

# This is an input class. Do not edit.

# 0 -> 1 ->
